Calculates auction values for fantasy baseball players in a head-to-head league with non-standard scoring categories

I built these scripts to help me prepare for my fantasy baseball draft. There are lots of auction calculators out there, but most are aimed at the rotisserie scoring format and not head-to-head. I also wanted to integrate my league's specific information (position eligibility, keeper salaries) into the auction value spreadsheet.

I first developed this project as a way to learn Python in 2013 and have modified it each year (now with version control in 2017). It's been fun tinkering away at this over the years and honing my Python chops. Of course, there's still room for improvement.
